which-key provides the minor mode which-key-mode for Emacs. The mode displays
the key bindings following your currently entered incomplete command (a
prefix) in a popup. For example, after enabling the minor mode if you enter
C-x and wait for the default of 1 second the minibuffer will expand with all
of the available key bindings that follow C-x (or as many as space allows
given your settings). This includes prefixes like C-x 8 which are shown in a
different face. Screenshots of what the popup will look like along with
information about additional features can be found at
