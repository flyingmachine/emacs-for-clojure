1 Introduction
**************

With Magit, you can inspect and modify your Git repositories with
Emacs.  You can review and commit the changes you have made to the
tracked files, for example, and you can browse the history of past
changes.  There is support for cherry picking, reverting, merging,
rebasing, and other common Git operations.

   Magit is not a complete interface to Git; it just aims to make the
most common Git operations convenient.  Thus, Magit will likely not
save you from learning Git itself.

   This manual provides a tour of all Magit features.  It does not give
a introduction to version control in general, or to Git in particular.

   The main entry point to Magit is `M-x magit-status', which will put
you in Magit's status buffer.  You will be using it frequently, so it
is probably a good idea to bind `magit-status' to a key of your choice.

   In addition to the status buffer, Magit will also create buffers that
show lists of commits, buffers with diffs, and other kinds of buffers.
All these buffers are in `magit-mode' and have the same key bindings.
Not all commands make sense in all contexts, but a given key will
always do the same thing in all Magit buffers.

   Naturally, Magit runs the `git' command to do most of the work.  The
`*magit-process*' buffer contains the transcript of the most recent
command.  You can switch to it with `$'.

3 Sections
**********

All Magit buffers are structured into nested 'sections'.  These
sections can be hidden and shown individually.  When a section is
hidden, only its first line is shown and all its children are
completely invisible.

   The most fine-grained way to control the visibility of sections is
the `TAB' key.  It will to toggle the current section (the section that
contains point) between being hidden and being shown.

   Typing `S-TAB' toggles the visibility of the children of the current
section.  When all of them are shown, they will all be hidden.
Otherwise, when some or all are hidden, they will all be shown.

   The digit keys `1', `2', `3', and `4' control the visibility of
sections based on levels.  Hitting `2', for example, will show sections
on levels one and two, and will hide sections on level 3.  However,
only sections that are a parent or child of the current section are
affected.

   For example, when the current section is on level 3 and you hit `1',
the grand-parent of the current section (which is on level one) will be
shown, and the parent of the current section (level 2) will be hidden.
The visibility of no other section will be changed.

   This sounds a bit complicated, but you'll figure it out.

   Using `M-1', `M-2', `M-3', and `M-4' is similar to the unmodified
digits, but now all sections on the respective level are affected,
regardless of whether or not they are related to the current section.

   For example, `M-1' will only show the first lines of the top-level
sections and will hide everything else.  Typing `M-4' on the other hand
will show everything.

   Because of the way the status buffer is set up, some changes to
section visibility are more common than others.  Files are on level 2
and diff hunks are on level 4.  Thus, you can type `2' to collapse the
diff of the current file, and `M-2' to collapse all files.  This
returns the status buffer to its default setup and is a quick way to
unclutter it after drilling down into the modified files.

   Because `2' and `M-2' are so common in the status buffer, they are
bound to additional, more mnemonic keys: `M-h' (hide) and `M-H' (hide
all).  Likewise `4' and `M-4' are also available as `M-s' (show) and
`M-S' (show all).

   In other buffers than the status buffer, `M-h', `M-H', `M-s', and
`M-S' might work on different levels than on 2 and 4, but they keep
their general meaning: `M-H' hides all detail, and `M-S' shows
everything.

4 Status
********

Running `M-x magit-status' displays the main interface of Magit, the
status buffer.  You can have multiple status buffers active at the same
time, each associated with its own Git repository.

   When invoking `M-x magit-status' from within a Git repository, it
will switch to the status buffer of that repository.  Otherwise, it
will prompt for a directory.  With a prefix argument, it will always
prompt.

   You can set `magit-repo-dirs' to customize how `magit-status' asks
for the repository to work on.  When `magit-repo-dirs' is nil,
`magit-status' will simply ask for a directory.

   If you specify a directory that is not a Git repository, `M-x
magit-status' will offer to initialize it as one.

   When `magit-repo-dirs' is not nil, it is treated as a list of
directory names, and `magit-status' will find all Git repositories in
those directories and offer them for completion.  (Magit will only look
`magit-repo-dirs-depth' levels deep, however.)

   With two prefix arguments, `magit-status' will always prompt for a
raw directory.

   Thus, you would normally set `magit-repo-dirs' to the places where
you keep most of your Git repositories and switch between them with
`C-u M-x magit-status'.  If you want to go to a repository outside of
your normal working areas, or if you want to create a new repository,
you would use `C-u C-u M-x magit-status'.

   You need to explicitly refresh the status buffer when you have made
changes to the repository from outside of Emacs.  You can type `g' in
the status buffer itself, or just use `M-x magit-status' instead of
`C-x b' when switching to it.  You also need to refresh the status
buffer in this way after saving a file in Emacs.

   The header at the top of the status buffer shows a short summary of
the repository state: where it is located, which branch is checked out,
etc.  Below the header are a number of sections that show details about
the working tree and the staging area.  You can hide and show them as
described in the previous section.

   The first section shows _Untracked files_, if there are any.  See
*note Untracked files:: for more details.

   Two section show your local changes.  They are explained fully in the
next chapter, *note Staging and Committing::.

   If the current branch is associated with a remote tracking branch,
the status buffer shows the differences between the current branch and
the tracking branch.  See *note Pushing and Pulling:: for more
information.

   During a history rewriting session, the status buffer shows the
_Pending changes_ and _Pending commits_ sections.  See *note
Rewriting:: for more details.


File: magit.info,  Node: Untracked files,  Next: Staging and Committing,  Prev: Status,  Up: Top

5 Untracked files
*****************

Untracked files are shown in the _Untracked files_ section.

   You can add a untracked file to the staging area with `s'.  If point
is on the _Untracked files_ section title when you it `s', all
untracked files are staged.

   Typing `C-u S' anywhere will also stage all untracked files,
together with all changes to the tracked files.

   You can instruct Git to ignore them by typing `i'.  This will add
the filename to the `.gitignore' file.  Typing `C-u i' will ask you for
the name of the file to ignore.  This is useful to ignore whole
directories, for example.  The `I' command is similar to `i' but will
add the file to `.git/info/exclude' instead.

   To delete a untracked file forever, use `k'.  If point is on the
_Untracked files_ section title when you it `k', all untracked files
are deleted.


File: magit.info,  Node: Staging and Committing,  Next: History,  Prev: Untracked files,  Up: Top

6 Staging and Committing
************************

Comitting with Git is a two step process: first you add the changes you
want to commit to a 'staging area', and then you commit them to the
repository.  This allows you to only commit a subset of your local
changes.

   Magit allows you to ignore the staging area if you wish.  As long as
your staging area is unused, Magit will show your uncomitted changes in
a section named _Changes_.

   When the staging area is in use, Magit uses two sections: _Unstaged
changes_ and _Staged changes_.  The _Staged changes_ section shows the
changes that will be included in the next commit, while the _Unstaged
changes_ section shows the changes that will be left out.

   To move a unstaged hunk into the staging area, move point into the
hunk and type `s'.  Likewise, to unstage a hunk, move point into it and
type `u'.  If point is in a diff header when you type `s' or `u', all
hunks belonging to that diff are moved at the same time.

   If the region is active when you type `s' or `u', only the changes
in the region are staged or unstaged.  (This works line by line: if the
beginning of a line is in the region it is included in the changes,
otherwise it is not.)

   Typing `C-u s' will ask you for a name of a file to be staged, for
example to stage files that are hidden.

   To move all hunks of all diffs into the staging area in one go, type
`S'.  To unstage everything, type `U'.

   Typing `C-u S' will stage all untracked files in addition to the
changes to tracked files.

   You can discard uncommitted changes by moving point into a hunk and
typing `k'.  The changes to discard are selected as with `s' and `u'.

   Before committing, you should write a short description of the
changes.

   Type `c' to pop up a buffer where you can write your change
description.  Once you are happy with the description, type `C-c C-c'
in that buffer to perform the commit.

   If you want to write changes in a `ChangeLog' file, you can use `C-x
4 a' on a diff hunk.

   Typing `c' when the staging area is unused is a special situation.
Normally, the next commit would be empty, but you can configure Magit
to do something more useful by customizing the
`magit-commit-all-when-nothing-staged' variable.  One choice is to
instruct the subsequent `C-c C-c' to commit all changes.  Another
choice is stage everything at the time of hitting `c'.

   You can type `C-c C-a' in the buffer with the change description to
toggle a flag that determines whether the next commit will _amend_ the
current commit in HEAD.

   Typing `C-c C-s' will toggle the `--signoff' option.  The default is
determined by the `magit-commit-signoff' customization variable.

   Typing `C-c C-e' will toggle the `--allow-empty' option.  This
allows you to make commits that serve as notes, without including any
changes.

   If you change your mind and don't want to go ahead with your commit
while you are in the `*magit-log-edit*' buffer, you can just switch to
another buffer, continue editing there, staging and unstaging things
until you are happy, and then return to the `*magit-log-edit*' buffer,
maybe via `C-x b', or by hitting `c' again in a Magit buffer.

   If you want to erase the `*magit-log-edit*' buffer and bury it, you
can hit `C-c C-k' in it.

   Typing `C' will also pop up the change description buffer, but in
addition, it will try to insert a ChangeLog-style entry for the change
that point is in.


File: magit.info,  Node: History,  Next: Reflogs,  Prev: Staging and Committing,  Up: Top

7 History
*********

To show the repository history of your current head, type `l l'.  A new
buffer will be shown that displays the history in a terse form.  The
first paragraph of each commit message is displayed, next to a
representation of the relationships between commits.

   Giving a prefix argument to `l' will ask for the starting and end
point of the history.  This can be used to show the commits that are in
one branch, but not in another, for example.  The start point can also
be a range of revisions "r1..r2".  In that case "r1" is used as the
start and "r2" as the end point of the history.

   Typing `l L' (or `l C-u L') will show the log in a more verbose form.

   Magit will show only `magit-log-cutoff-length' entries. `e' will
show twice as many entries. `C-u e' will show all entries, and given a
numeric prefix argument, `e' will add this number of entries. You can
also show more entries by typing `RET' on the text appended at the end
of the buffer.

   You can move point to a commit and then cause various things to
happen with it.  (The following commands work in any list of commit,
such as the one shown in the _Unpushed commits_ section.)

   Typing `RET' will pop up more information about the current commit
and move point into the new buffer.  Typing `SPC' and `DEL' will also
show the information, but will scroll the new buffer up or down
(respectively) when typed again.

   Typing `a' will apply the current commit to your current branch.
This is useful when you are browsing the history of some other branch
and you want to `cherry-pick' some changes from it.  A typical
situation is applying selected bug fixes from the development version
of a program to a release branch.  The cherry-picked changes will not
be committed automatically; you need to do that explicitly.

   Typing `A' will cherry-pick the current commit and will also commit
the changes automatically when there have not been any conflicts.

   Typing `v' will revert the current commit.  Thus, it will apply the
changes made by that commit in reverse.  This is obviously useful to
cleanly undo changes that turned out to be wrong.  As with `a', you
need to commit the changes explicitly.

   Typing `C-w' will copy the sha1 of the current commit into the kill
ring.

   Typing `=' will show the differences from the current commit to the
"marked" commit.

   You can mark the current commit by typing `.'.  When the current
commit is already marked, typing `.' will unmark it.  To unmark the
marked commit no matter where point is, use `C-u .'.

   Some commands, such as `=', will use the current commit and the
marked commit as implicit arguments.  Other commands will offer the
marked commit as a default when prompting for their arguments.

   To grep the history press `s'.

8 Reflogs
*********

You can use `l h' and `l H' to browse your _reflog_, the local history
of changes made to your repository heads.  Typing `H' will ask for a
head, while `l h' will show the reflog of `HEAD'.

   The resulting buffer is just like the buffer produced by `l l' and
`l L' that shows the commit history.


File: magit.info,  Node: Diffing,  Next: Tagging,  Prev: Reflogs,  Up: Top

9 Diffing
*********

To show the changes from you working tree to another revision, type
`d'.  To show the changes between two arbitrary revisions, type `D'.

   You can use `a' within the diff output to apply the changes to your
working tree.  As usual when point is in a diff header for a file, all
changes for that file are applied, and when it is in a hunk, only that
hunk is.  When the region is active, the applied changes are restricted
to that region.

   Typing `v' will apply the selected changes in reverse.


File: magit.info,  Node: Tagging,  Next: Resetting,  Prev: Diffing,  Up: Top

10 Tagging
**********

Typing `t t' will make a lighweight tag.  Typing `t T' will make a
annotated tag.  It will put you in the normal `*magit-log-edit' buffer
for writing commit messages, but typing `C-c C-c' in it will make the
tag instead.  This is controlled by the `Tag' field that will be added
to the `*magit-log-edit*' buffer.  You can edit it, if you like.


File: magit.info,  Node: Resetting,  Next: Stashing,  Prev: Tagging,  Up: Top

11 Resetting
************

Once you have added a commit to your local repository, you can not
change that commit anymore in any way.  But you can reset your current
head to an earlier commit and start over.

   If you have published your history already, rewriting it in this way
can be confusing and should be avoided.  However, rewriting your local
history is fine and it is often cleaner to fix mistakes this way than
by reverting commits (with `v', for example).

   Typing `x' will ask for a revision and reset your current head to
it.  No changes will be made to your working tree and staging area.
Thus, the _Staged changes_ section in the status buffer will show the
changes that you have removed from your commit history.  You can commit
the changes again as if you had just made them, thus rewriting history.

   Typing `x' while point is in a line that describes a commit will
offer this commit as the default revision to reset to.  Thus, you can
move point to one of the commits in the _Unpushed commits_ section and
hit `x RET' to reset your current head to it.

   Type `X' to reset your working tree and staging area to the most
recently committed state.  This will discard your local modifications,
so be careful.

   You can give a prefix to `x' if you want to reset both the current
head and your working tree to a given commit.  This is the same as
first using an unprefixed `x' to reset only the head, and then using
`X'.


File: magit.info,  Node: Stashing,  Next: Branching,  Prev: Resetting,  Up: Top

12 Stashing
***********

You can create a new stash with `z z'.  Your stashes will be listed in
the status buffer, and you can apply them with `a' and pop them with
`A'.  To drop a stash, use `k'.

   With a prefix argument, both `a' and `A' will attempt to reinstate
the index as well as the working tree from the stash.

   Typing `z Z' will create a stash just like `z z', but will leave the
changes in your working tree and index.

   You can visit and show stashes in the usual way: Typing `SPC' and
`DEL' will pop up a buffer with the description of the stash and scroll
it, typing `RET' will move point into that buffer. Using `C-u RET' will
move point into that buffer in other window.


File: magit.info,  Node: Branching,  Next: The branch list,  Prev: Stashing,  Up: Top

13 Branching
************

The current branch is indicated in the header of the status buffer.
You can switch to a different branch by typing `b c'.  This will
immediately checkout the branch into your working copy, so you
shouldn't have any local modifications when switching branches.

   If you try to switch to a remote branch, Magit will offer to create a
local tracking branch for it instead.  This way, you can easily start
working on new branches that have appeared in a remote repository.

   Typing `b c' while point is at a commit description will offer that
commit as the default to switch to.  This will result in a detached
head.

   To create a new branch and switch to it immediately, type `b B'.

   Typing `b V' will list the local and remote branches in a new buffer
called `*magit-branches*' from which you can work with them. See *note
The branch list:: for more details.


File: magit.info,  Node: The branch list,  Next: Wazzup,  Prev: Branching,  Up: Top

14 The branch list
******************

The branch list is a separate buffer called `*magit-branches*' with its
own local key map. The keybindings are modeled after magit's main
buffer. The buffer contains both local and remote branches. The current
local branch is marked by a "*" in front of the name.

   Typing `k' will delete the branch in the current line, and `C-u k'
deletes it even if it hasn't been merged into the current local branch.
Deleting works for both local and remote branches.

   You can merge the branch in the current line by typing `m m' for a
manual merge and `m m' for an automatic merge.

   With `RET' or `b b' you can check out the branch in the current line.

   Typing `$' shows the `*magit-process*' buffer which contains the
transcript of the most recent command.

   Typing `V' will refresh the branch list. `q' buries the branch list
buffer and deletes its window.


File: magit.info,  Node: Wazzup,  Next: Merging,  Prev: The branch list,  Up: Top

15 Wazzup
*********

Typing `w' will show a summary of how your other branches relate to the
current branch.

   For each branch, you will get a section that lists the commits in
that branch that are not in the current branch.  The sections are
initially collapsed; you need to explicitly open them with `TAB' (or
similar) to show the lists of commits.

   When point is on a _N unmerged commits in ..._ title, the
corresponding branch will be offered as the default for a merge.

   Hitting `i' on a branch title will ignore this branch in the wazzup
view.  You can use `C-u w' to show all branches, including the ignored
ones.  Hitting `i' on an already ignored branch in that view will
unignore it.


File: magit.info,  Node: Merging,  Next: Rebasing,  Prev: Wazzup,  Up: Top

16 Merging
**********

Magit offers two ways to merge branches: manually and automatic.  A
manual merge will apply all changes to your working tree and staging
area, but will not commit them, while a automatic merge will go ahead
and commit them immediately.

   Type `m m' to initiate merge.

   After initiating a merge, the header of the status buffer might
remind you that the next commit will be a merge commit (with more than
one parent).  If you want to abort a manual merge, just do a hard reset
to HEAD with `X'.

   Merges can fail if the two branches you merge want to introduce
conflicting changes.  In that case, the automatic merge stops before the
commit, essentially falling back to a manual merge.  You need to resolve
the conflicts for example with `e' and stage the resolved files, for
example with `S'.

   You can not stage individual hunks one by one as you resolve them,
you can only stage whole files once all conflicts in them have been
resolved.


File: magit.info,  Node: Rebasing,  Next: Rewriting,  Prev: Merging,  Up: Top

17 Rebasing
***********

Typing `R' in the status buffer will initiate a rebase or, if one is
already in progress, ask you how to continue.

   When a rebase is stopped in the middle because of a conflict, the
header of the status buffer will indicate how far along you are in the
series of commits that are being replayed.  When that happens, you
should resolve the conflicts and stage everything and hit `R c' to
continue the rebase.  Alternatively, hitting `c' or `C' while in the
middle of a rebase will also ask you whether to continue the rebase.

   Of course, you can initiate a rebase in any number of ways, by
configuring `git pull' to rebase instead of merge, for example.  Such a
rebase can be finished with `R' as well.


File: magit.info,  Node: Rewriting,  Next: Pushing and Pulling,  Prev: Rebasing,  Up: Top

18 Rewriting
************

As hinted at earlier, you can rewrite your commit history.  For
example, you can reset the current head to an earlier commit with `x'.
This leaves the working tree unchanged, and the status buffer will show
all the changes that have been made since that new value of the current
head.  You can commit these changes again, possibly splitting them into
multiple commits as you go along.

   Amending your last commit is a common special case of rewriting
history like this.

   Another common way to rewrite history is to reset the head to an
earlier commit, and then to cherry pick the previous commits in a
different order.  You could pick them from the reflog, for example.

   Magit has several commands that can simplify the book keeping
associated with rewriting.  These commands all start with the `r'
prefix key.

   Typing `r b' will start a rewrite operation.  You will be prompted
for a _base_ commit, and all commits between the current head and this
commit are put in a list of _Pending commits_ (including the base
commit).  The current head will then be reset to the parent of the base
commit.

   You would then typically use `a' and `A' to cherry pick commits from
the list of pending commits in the desired order, until all have been
applied.  Magit shows which commits have been applied by changing their
marker from `*' to `.'.

   Using `A' will immediately commit the commit (as usual).  If you
want to combine multiple previous commits into a single new one, use
`a' to apply them all to your working tree, and then commit them
together.

   Magit has no explicit support for rewriting merge commits.  It will
happily include merge commits in the list of pending commits, but there
is no way of replaying them automatically.  You have to redo the merge
explicitly.

   You can also use `v' to revert a commit when you have changed your
mind.  This will change the `.' mark back to `*'.

   Once you are done with the rewrite, type `r t' to remove the book
keeping information from the status buffer.

   If you rather wish to start over, type `r a'.  This will abort the
rewriting, resetting the current head back to the value it had before
the rewrite was started with `r s'.

   Typing `r f' will _finish_ the rewrite: it will apply all unused
commits one after the other, as if you would us `A' with all of them.

   You can change the `*' and `.' marks of a pending commit explicitly
with `r *' and `r .'.

   In addition to a list of pending commits, the status buffer will show
the _Pending changes_.  This section shows the diff between the
original head and the current head.  You can use it to review the
changes that you still need to rewrite, and you can apply hunks from
it, like from any other diff.


File: magit.info,  Node: Pushing and Pulling,  Next: Submodules,  Prev: Rewriting,  Up: Top

19 Pushing and Pulling
**********************

Magit will run `git push' when you type `P p'.  If you give a prefix
argument to `P p', you will be prompted for the repository to push to.
When no default remote repository has been configured yet for the
current branch, you will be prompted as well.  Typing `P p' will only
push the current branch to the remote.  In other words, it will run
`git push <remote> <branch>'.  The branch will be created in the remote
if it doesn't exist already.  The local branch will be configured so
that it pulls from the new remote branch.

   Typing `f f' will run `git remote update'.  With a prefix arg, it
will prompt for the name of the remote to update.  Typing `F p' will
run `git pull'.  When you don't have a default branch configured to be
pulled into the current one, you will be asked for it.

   If there is a default remote repository for the current branch, Magit
will show that repository in the status buffer header.

   In this case, the status buffer will also have a _Unpushed commits_
section that shows the commits on your current head that are not in the
branch named `<remote>/<branch>'.  This section works just like the
history buffer: you can see details about a commit with `RET', compare
two of them with `.' and `=', and you can reset your current head to
one of them with `x', for example. If you want to push the changes then
type `P p'.

   When the remote branch has changes that are not in the current
branch, Magit shows them in a section called _Unpulled changes_.  Typing
`F p' will merge them into the current branch.

*************

`M u'
     Update the submodules, with a prefix argument it will initializing.

`M i'
     Initialize the submodules.

`M b'
     Update and initialize the submodules in one go.

`M s'
     Synchronizes submodules' remote URL configuration setting to the
     value specified in .gitmodules.

21.1 Interfacing with Subversion
================================

Typing `N r' runs `git svn rebase', typing `N c' runs `git svn dcommit'
and typing `N f' runs `git svn fetch'.

   `N s' will prompt you for a (numeric, Subversion) revision and then
search for a corresponding Git sha1 for the commit. This is limited to
the path of the remote Subversion repository. With a prefix (`C-u N s'
the user will also be prompted for a branch to search in.

21.2 Interfacing with Topgit
============================

Topgit (http://repo.or.cz/r/topgit.git) is a patch queue manager that
aims at being close as possible to raw Git, which makes it easy to use
with Magit. In particular, it does not require to use a different set of
commands for "commit", "update",… operations.

   `magit-topgit.el' provides basic integration with Magit, mostly by
providing a "Topics" section.

   Topgit branches can be created the regular way, by using a "t/"
prefix by convention. So, creating a "t/foo" branch will actually
populate the "Topics" section with one more branch after committing
`.topdeps' and `.topmsg'.

   Also, the way we pull (see *note Pushing and Pulling::) such a
branch is slightly different, since it requires updating the various
dependencies of that branch. This should be mostly transparent, except
in case of conflicts.

21.3 Developing Extensions
==========================

Magit provides a generic mechanism to allow cooperation with Git-related
systems, such as foreign VCS, patch systems,…

   In particular it allows to:

   * Define sections to display specific informations about the current
     state of the repository, and place them relatively to existing
     sections.

     `magit-define-inserter' automagically defines two hooks called
     `magit-before-insert-SECTION-hook' and
     `magit-after-insert-SECTION-hook' that allow to generate and place
     more sections.

     In the following example, we use the builtin "stashes" section to
     place our own "foo" one.

          (magit-define-inserter foo ()
            (magit-git-section 'foo
                               "Foo:" 'foo-wash-function
                               "foo" "arg1" "arg2"))
          (add-hook 'magit-after-insert-stashes-hook 'magit-insert-foo)

   * Define new types of objects in those sections.

     The function `foo-wash-function' defined above post-processes each
     line of the output of the "git foo arg1 arg2" command, and is able
     to associate a type to certain lines.

     A simple implementation could be:

          (defun foo-wash-function ()
            (let ((foo (buffer-substring (line-beginning-position) (line-end-position))))
              (goto-char (line-beginning-position))
              (magit-with-section foo 'foo
                (magit-set-section-info foo)
                (forward-line))))

     In this case, every line of the command output is transformed into
     an object of type `'foo'.

   * Alter behavior of generic commands to dispatch them correctly to
     the relevant system, optionally making use of the newly defined
     types.

          (magit-add-action (item info "discard")
            ((foo)
             (do-something-meaningful-for-discarding-a-foo)))

     This will alter the behavior of `k', when applied to those objects.

   * Plug a different logic into basic commands, to reflect the
     presence of the extension.

     `magit-define-command' automagically defines a
     `magit-CMD-command-hook' that can contain a list of functions to
     call before the actual core code. Execution stops after the first
     hook that returns a non-nil value. This leaves room for extension
     logic.

          (add-hook 'magit-create-branch-command-hook 'foo-create-branch)

     The function `foo-create-branch' will be called each time an
     attempt is made to create a branch, and can, for example, react to
     a certain name convention.

   * Define new commands and associated menu.

     This part is not really specific to extensions, except that menus
     take place in the "Extensions" submenu.

22 Using Git Directly
*********************

For situations when Magit doesn't do everything you need, you can run
raw Git commands using `:'.  This will prompt for a Git command, run
it, and refresh the status buffer.  The output can be viewed by typing
`$'.
