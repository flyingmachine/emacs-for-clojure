;;; Commentary:

;; If you use the excellent `ido-mode' for efficient completion of
;; file names and buffers, you might wonder if you can get ido-style
;; completion everywhere else too. Well, that's what this package
;; does! ido-ubiquitous is here to enable ido-style completion for
;; (almost) every function that uses the standard completion function
;; `completing-read'.

From the `completing-read' docstring:

> If the input is null, `completing-read' returns DEF, or the
> first element of the list of default values, or an empty string
> if DEF is nil, regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH.

If this variable is non-nil, then ido-ubiquitous will attempt to
emulate this behavior. Specifically, if RET is pressed
immediately upon entering completion, an empty string will be
returned instead of the first element in the list. This behavior
is only enabled when ido is being used as a substitute for
`completing-read', and not when it is used directly.

This odd behavior is required for compatibility with an old-style
usage pattern whereby the default was requested by returning an
empty string. In this mode, the caller receives the empty string
and handles the default case manually, while `completing-read'
never has any knowledge of the default. This is a problem for
ido, which always returns the first element in the list when the
input is empty. Without knowledge of the default, it cannot
ensure that the default is first on the list, so returning the
first item is not the correct behavior. Instead, it must return
an empty string like `completing-read'.

You can termporarily invert this behavior by prefixing \"RET\"
with \"C-u\".

If you want to enable old-style default selection selectively for
specific commands or functions, set appropriate overrides in
`ido-ubiquitous-command-overrides' or
`ido-ubiquitous-function-overrides'."

  "List of command override specifications for ido-ubiquitous

Each override specification describes how ido-ubiquitous should
behave one or many commands. A specification has the
form `(BEHAVIOR MATCH-TYPE MATCH-TEXT)'. BEHAVIOR is one of the
following:

  * `disable': ido-ubiquitous should not be used at all for the
    specified commands;
  * `enable': ido-ubiquitous may be used with the specified
    commands, without emulating the old-style default selection
    of `completing-read';
  * `enable-old': ido-ubiquitous may be used with the specified
    commands, and should emulate the old-style default selection
    of `completing-read'.

MATCH-TYPE affects how MATCH-TEXT is interpreted, as follows:

  * `exact': the specification only affects the one command
    whose name is MATCH-TEXT;
  * `prefix': the specification affects any command whose name
    starts with MATCH-TEXT (This is useful for specifying a
    certain behavior for an entire package);
  * `regexp': the specification affects any command whose name
    matches MATCH-TEXT (with MATCH-TEXT being interpreted as a
    regular expression)

MATCH-TEXT should be a string.

Since this variable's has a somewhat complex structure, it is
recommended that you set this variable through Customize.

Note that this variable only affects *commands*, which are
functions marked as interactive. See
`ido-ubiquitous-function-overrides' for how to modify the
behavior of ido-ubiquitous for arbitrary functions.
