# this is a Clojure-friendly emacs config

If you're new to emacs, check out
[this introductory tutorial](http://www.braveclojure.com/basic-emacs/)!

## Installing

1. Close Emacs.
2. Delete `~/.emacs` or `~/.emacs.d` if they exist. (Windows users, your
   emacs files will probably live in
   `C:\Users\your_user_name\AppData\Roaming\`. So, for example, you
   would delete `C:\Users\jason\AppData\Roaming\.emacs.d`.) This is
   where Emacs looks for configuration files, and deleting these files
   and directories will ensure that you start with a clean slate.
3. Download the Emacs
   [configuration zip file](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs-for-clojure/archive/book1.zip)
   and unzip it. Its contents should be a folder,
   `emacs-for-clojure-book1`. Run `mv path/to/emacs-for-clojure-book1
   ~/.emacs.d`.

Then open Emacs.

## Upgrading

Before upgrading, ensure that your `.emacs.d` directory is under
version control so that you can always revert to a known good state.

To upgrade:

1. Edit `.emacs.d/init.el`, adding these lines after line 12:

   ```elisp
   (add-to-list 'package-archives
                '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
   
   (add-to-list 'package-pinned-packages '(cider . "melpa-stable") t)
   ```

2. Close Emacs.
3. Run `rm -Rf .emacs.d/elpa/cider-*`
4. Open Emacs. You'll probably see some errors and your theme won't
   load. That's ok.
5. In Emacs, run `M-x package-refresh contents`.
6. In Emacs, run `M-x package-install cider`.
7. Close and re-open Emacs.

That should install the latest version. Enjoy!

## Organization

I've tried to separate everything logically and document the purpose
of every line. [`init.el`](./init.el) acts as a kind of table of
contents.  It's a good idea to eventually go through `init.el` and the
files under the `customizations` directory so that you know exactly
what's going on.

## Supporting CSS, HTML, JS, etc.

Emacs has decent support for CSS, HTML, JS, and many other file types out of the box, but if you want better support, then have a look at [my personal emacs config's init.el](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d/blob/master/init.el). It's meant to read as a table of contents. The emacs.d as a whole adds the following:

* [Customizes js-mode and html editing](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d/blob/master/customizations/setup-js.el)
    * Sets indentation level to 2 spaces for JS
    * enables subword-mode so that M-f and M-b break on capitalization changes
    * Uses `tagedit` to give you paredit-like functionality when editing html
    * adds support for coffee mode
* [Uses enh-ruby-mode for ruby editing](https://github.com/flyingmachine/emacs.d/blob/master/customizations/setup-ruby.el). enh-ruby-mode is a little nicer than the built-in ruby-mode, in my opinion.
    * Associates many filenames and extensions with enh-ruby-mode (.rb, .rake, Rakefile, etc)
    * Adds keybindings for running specs
* Adds support for YAML and SCSS using the yaml-mode and scss-mode packages

In general, if you want to add support for a language then you should be able to find good instructions for it through Google. Most of the time, you'll just need to install the "x-lang-mode" package for it.
